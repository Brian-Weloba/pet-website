    <h2>Pet Name: Jimmy</h2>

    <h3>How we met.</h3>
    <p>I found Jimmy two years ago. He was a stray who kept coming to our court to look for food. He was friendly and made friends with the guards who gave him the name 'Jimmy'. I honestly thought its a weird name for a dog. I was so used to dogs getting unique and frightening names like 'Bruno' or 'Simba',you know, a name that inspires fear in the heart anyone who hears it. But this dog's name was Jimmy, a name which sounds pretty docile even for a human. It kinda fit though. Unlike most dogs Jimmy was friendly even to me, a stranger. But Jimmy is anything but docile, well, maybe to humans, but to the hares he occasionally drags home he's the biggest and baddest dog there is. They probably call him 'Simba' or at least the hare eqivalent of that. I could go on forever about him but let me save some stories for another day. </p>
